A challenging hike to the highest and very prominent peak in the Aravis massif,
the Pointe Percée (2750m). We will attempt the traverse by ascending via the Cheminées de Sallanches
and use the normal route for the descent. The hike offers outstanding views over the Mont Blanc range.

<p style="color:red;font-weight:bold">
This is a very difficult hike (T5) and you have to be able to move safely across rock with the
occasional use of your hands and be comfortable with large exposure.
</p>

We park our cars at **Col des Annes (1710m)** and take the trail to the refuge de Gramusset. From here we
continue up the combe de Verts to arrive at the **Col de Verts**. After a short traverse we arrive
at the first (and most difficult) chimney with some class II scrambling but very good handholds.
After that it's a fun cruise to the summit of **Pointe Percée (2750m)**, never too difficult but challenging
enough to stay alert. After our picnic, we will descend via the normal route which is only marginally
easier and still requires our full concentration. Once back at the refuge de Gramusset
we retrace our steps to the car park.
