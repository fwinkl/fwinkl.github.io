A long hike in a the surprisingly remote and stunning valley along the border of France and Switzerland
with spectacular views from the summit.

We start the hike in **le Couteray**. After some walk through forest we get to the first key
passage of the hike. We use chains and ladders to ascend a rock face that brings us to the
entrance of the Tr√©-les-Eaux valley. We continue and ascend the **Col des Corbeaux** via a steep gully
up to the summit of **Pointe de la Terrasse (2734m)** (the last few meters are quite exposed but not
mandatory for those not feeling comfortable). We descend a very steep slope from the **Col de la Terrasse**
and follow the trail to the Refuge de Loriaz and back to our starting point.

This is a difficult hike and very long hike. You have to be comfortable using chains, ladders and hiking
on loose terrain.
