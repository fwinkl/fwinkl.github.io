On this hike we will explore three summits in the canton of Vaud with amazing views over the
lake and likely see plenty of [daffodils](https://www.narcisses.com).

We take the train from Geneva via Vevey to **Lally**, cross some bridges across a swamp area and
follow the trail to our first summit **Le Folly (1730m)**. We traverse the summit, descend about
100m and then hike up to our second summit **Le Molard (1752m)** where we will enjoy our lunch. From
here we will see your third summit the **Cape au Moine (1941m)** which we will reach after another
short descent and 350m of ascent. The last part to the summit is exposed and involves some
scrambling. For those not comfortable, they can wait at the col or make their way slowly to the **Les
Cases** train station while the others catch up.

Apart from the last summit, this is a hike on good trails without technical difficulties. It
is however rather long and a good physical fitness is required.
