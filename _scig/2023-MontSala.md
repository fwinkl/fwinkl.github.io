A (long) walk in the Jura from **La Cure** across **Mont Sâla (1511m)** and ending in **Saint-Cergue**.
There are no difficulties on this hike but you need to be able to walk 20 kilometers (~7 hours
including breaks). On a clear day, the hike offers outstanding views across the entire alpine range.

We finish the hike in Saint-Cergue and for those interested will end the hiking season with a
**fondue** in one of the restaurants. Return to Geneva via train.
