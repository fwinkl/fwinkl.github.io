A 3-day trek in the Bernese Oberland from Rosenlaui to Innertkirchen staying in two iconic mountain huts
and passing through impressive landscapes formed by glaciers.

The first day of this trek is a T4 alpine trail (blue-white) on steep terrain involving cables and ladders
and is partially very exposed (see for example this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkzssBdIVyI)).
You have to be comfortable on this type of trail and do not suffer from vertigo.

*In case of heavy rain, the hike will either have to be canceled or changed significantly as the ascent to the Dossenhütte will be too dangerous.*

## Itinerary
<b>Optional: Thursday, July 31{% include hikestats.html up="350m" down="0m" distance="5km" duration="3 hours" %}</b><br/>
We take the train from Geneva to [Aareschlucht](https://aareschlucht.ch/) (East) and walk through the gorge to its west entrance
(~45 minutes). From there we continue to the top of the impressive [Reichenbachfall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reichenbach_Falls)
where Sherlock Holmes fell to its death.
People staying at Rosenlaui/Schwarzwaldalp can take the (last) 16:34 bus from Zwirgi. People staying in the valley
can either take a bus, the cable car, a [Monster-Trotti](https://www.outdoor-for-fun.ch/monster-scooter-fun-for-young-and-old/sherlock-holmes-en)
or walk back down to Meiringen.

You book your own accommodation for Thursday night (e.g. in Rosenlaui or Meiringen).
On the next morning, we can meet at Rosenlaui around 10am to visit the [Rosenlaui Glacier Gorge](https://en.rosenlauischlucht.ch/en)
before the other group from Geneva arrives.

<b>Friday, Aug 1: {% include hikestats.html up="1300m" down="0m" distance="5km" duration="4 hours" %}</b><br/>
From Rosenlaui we hike through a forest on a normal hiking path until we reach the intersection with the
blue/white alpine trail to the [Dossenhütte (2663m)](https://dossenhuette.ch).
With the help of ladders and cables we climb the steep rock
face to the Rosenlaui bivouac. Following a rocky trail we arrive at the final ridge (secured by cables)
leading us to the hut.

<b>Saturday, Aug 2: {% include hikestats.html up="850m" down="1300m" distance="9km" duration="5 hours" %}</b><br/>
We traverse to the [Gaulihütte (2205m)](https://gaulihuette.ch/) today. Easier than yesterday but the first half is still on an alpine trail.
Once we reach the Urbach valley we join a normal hiking path that ascends to the hut.

<b>Sunday, Aug 3: {% include hikestats.html up="100m" down="1600m" distance="13km" duration="6 hours" %}</b><br/>
On our last day we will explore the scenic Gauli glacier lake and then take the hiking path back to the Urbach valley. We either walk
to Mürvorsess and take a taxi or walk another 1.5h to Innertkirchen.
