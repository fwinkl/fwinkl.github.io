The **Pic Chaussy (2351m)** is a very popular hike in the canton Vaud with superb views over Les Diablerets and its
summits. To avoid the crowds at least partially, we will start the hike in **Vers-l'Eglise (1125m)**,
traverse the summit and go down the normal route to **Les Mosses (1439)**.

The second part of our ascent is rather steep, sometimes without a clear path and
with a few easy but exposed steps. A sure foot and good physical fitness is needed.

For the brave ones, we will be passing by a lake on our return for a swim!
