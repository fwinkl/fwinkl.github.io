A 4-day trek from Täsch to Zermatt across alpine passes, glaciers and waking up on
Swiss National Day in the world famous Monte Rosa hut.

The trek requires good physical fitness and a sure foot. Several parts of this hike are classified as an
alpine trail (blue-white, T4) involving chains and a (marked) glacier crossing. You will need crampons
or spikes for this hike. But no prior glacier travel experience is required.


## Itinerary
<b>Day 1: {% include hikestats.html up="1300m" down="0m" distance="7km" duration="4 hours" %}</b><br/>
We take the train from Geneva to **Täsch** and hike via the Täschalp to the **[Täsch hut](https://www.taeschhuette.ch) (2700m)**. Those with enough energy can do an optional hike to the Alphubel lake (450m, 2h round-trip).

<b>Day 2: {% include hikestats.html up="800m" down="1200m" distance="13km" duration="6 hours" %}</b><br/>
We leave the hut after breakfast and ascend the **Pfulwe pass (3155m)** with a short section
protected by chains. We descend via the Berghaus Fluhalp where we can stop for some
refreshments. We continue along the 5 lakes trail passing Grindjesee and Grünsee
to arrive at the **[Mountain Lodge ze Seewjinu](https://www.zeseewjinu.ch) (2300m)**.

<b>Day 3: {% include hikestats.html up="1300m" down="650m" distance="13km" duration="7 hours" %}</b><br/>
We hike up to the Gornergratsee lake and will reach the impressive **Gorner glacier** either
via Rotenboden or the (slightly longer) Gornergrat variant. Now it is time to put on our crampons
to cross the glacier along some big crevasses and then continue along the new Panorama trail
to reach the **[Monte Rosa hut](https://monterosahuette.ch) (2882m)**.

<b>Day 4: {% include hikestats.html up="350m" down="1600m" distance="18km" duration="8 hours" %}</b><br/>
We retrace our steps from the previous day to reach **Rotenboden** and start the long descent
to Zermatt. Along the way we will pass trough the **glacier garden** at Dossen, traverse a
suspension bridge and potentially visit the Gorner gorge.
