A hike to the highest **point of the Suisse Jura**. We are doing this hike late in the season to profit
from the cold (and dry!) air that usually provides spectacular long range visibility over the entire
alpine range from Jungfrau to Mont Blanc.

We take the train+bus to **Montricher** and hike up a well maintained trail to the summit of Mont
Tendre (~3 hours). We will have lunch on the summit and continue along the Jura Crest Trail to
the Col du Marchairuz (~2 hours) where we should have some time for a drink before taking the
bus back to Geneva. This hike has no particular difficulties but the elevation gain of 1000m is at the
upper limit of “medium”.
