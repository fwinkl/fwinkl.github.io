A traverse of two iconic mountains in the Swiss Prealps overlooking the region of Gruyères.
With good visibility we will see a panorama of the entire Alpine range and of course Lake Geneva.
The trail has some **exposed** sections and requires a sure foot.

We will take the train and bus to **Les Paccots (1100m)** and ascend **Teysachaux (1909m)** via its
SW ridge. From the top we descend on a steep, grassy and rocky ridge to the Crête de Moléson which
we follow to the summit of **Le Moléson (2002m)**. From the summit we will skip the cable car
and hike down to it base from where we will take a bus and train back to Geneva.
