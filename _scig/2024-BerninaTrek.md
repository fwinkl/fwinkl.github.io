A 4-day trek in the Bernina massif where we will pass "Fuorclas", climb one or more "Piz" and stay in three different "Chamanna".

The trek requires good physical fitness and to be able to walk up to 8 hours.
The main hike is following well marked trails (white-red, T3) without major difficulties. For the adventurous
there will be opportunities for some rock scrambling.

## Itinerary
<b>Day 1: {% include hikestats.html up="900m" down="0m" distance="13km" duration="5 hours" %}</b><br/>
We take the train from Geneva to **Spinas**. This train ride by itself is already worth the trip as
we will be traveling on the Unesco World Cultural Heritage [Albula/Bernina
railway](https://www.myswitzerland.com/en-ch/experiences/rhaetian-railway-albulabernina/) passing
the iconic Landwasser viaduct. Arriving in Spinas we hike (under the watch of many marmots) through
Val Bever to **[Chamanna Jenatsch](https://www.chamannajenatsch.ch/) (2653m)** where we spend
the night.

<b>Day 2: {% include hikestats.html up="850m" down="1700m" distance="25km" duration="9 hours" %}</b><br/>
This is our longest day. We leave the hut early after breakfast to ascend the **Fuorcla Suvretta (2966m)** 
and following the panoramic trail passing Lej (lake) Suvretta down to Silvaplana. We take
the cable car to the Corvatsch middle station (Murtèl) and ascend the Fuorcla Surlej with the
breathtaking panorama over the Bernina massif. After another 3-4 hours we will arrive at **[Chamanna
Coaz](https://www.coaz.ch) (2610m)**.

<b>Day 3: {% include hikestats.html up="650m" down="650m" distance="13km" duration="5 hours" %}</b><br/>
Today is a shorter day, so we have some time to explore the surroundings of the hut. Options include
a glacier experience trail, a hike to a nearby mountain lake, ascend Piz dal Lej Alv (3195m, T4+,
2-3h) or simply relax on the terrace. After an early lunch we will start our hike via the Val Roseg
to the **[Tschierva hut](https://tschierva.ch) (2584m)**.

<b>Day 4: {% include hikestats.html up="0m" down="800m" distance="12km" duration="4 hours" %}</b><br/>
We will use the morning to get a close-up view of Piz Bernina and its famous Bianco ridge.
If conditions are perfect, those with enough energy, could consider ascending Piz Morteratsch. After
lunch we will descend via Val Roseg to Pontresina from where we take a train back to Geneva.
