A hike in the Passy National Reserve to **Lac de Pormenaz** and **Pointe Noire (2,323 m)** with
the impressive Aravis range and the Fiz massif as our backdrop. Ladders and some cables plus
the possibility to go for a swim add some extra excitement to this hike.

We park our cars in **Plaine Joux** and follow the very popular trail to Lac Vert and continue
to the Chalets de Souay. Here we take the adventurous route along **la Chorde** where cables and
ladders will help us across the tricky parts. After arriving at the lake, we will continue to the
**Pointe Noire** where will have spectacular views of the Mont Blanc massif. We return the same
way down to the lake where those interested can take a swim. After that refreshment we return via
the easy path to les Argentieres and back to the parking.

This is a long hike and requires good physical fitness and a sure foot for the few exposed
sections.
