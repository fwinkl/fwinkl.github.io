For this year's Jeûne Genevois, we are doing the Italian half of the Tour des Combins (the Swiss half
may come next year). The hike is mostly on well marked trails without
major technical difficulties. But each day is long (6-8 hours of walking with significant altitude gain)
so you have to be in very good physical shape.

## Itinerary
<b>Day 1: {% include hikestats.html up="800m" down="170m" distance="11km" duration="4 hours" %}</b><br/>
We take a train and bus to the Mauvoisin dam and hike along a hiking path above the lake
to the newly renovated **[Cabane de Chanrion](https://www.chanrion.ch)**, which actually belongs to
the Geneva section of the Club Alpin Suisse.

<b>Day 2: {% include hikestats.html up="1100m" down="1100m" distance="23km" duration="8 hours" %}</b><br/>
Today we cross the Fenêtre de Durand into Italy. After a steep climb in the morning we have a long walk
along the south side of the Grand Combins and arrive at the **[Rifugio Champillon](https://rifugio-champillon.it)**.

<b>Day 3: {% include hikestats.html up="1200m" down="1200m" distance="20km" duration="8 hours" %}</b><br/>
We continue our trek through the Aosta valley and hike back up to the Grand St-Bernard pass which brings
us back to Switzerland. Once all the day-tourists are gone, this is very special place and we stay in
the iconic **[Hospice du Grand-Saint-Bernard](https://gsbernard.com)**.

<b>Day 4: {% include hikestats.html up="900m" down="1700m" distance="18km" duration="7 hours" %}</b><br/>
Depending on everybody's energy there are multiple options to finish our last day. We can either follow
the official Tour des Combins, or take a more adventurous option that involves passing over
the Pointe de Drône. In either case we will arrive in Bourg-St-Pierre from where we travel back to Geneva.
