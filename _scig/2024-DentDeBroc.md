We will hike from chocolate heaven (Broc) to fondue heaven (Gruyères). But of course not the easy
way...

We start the hike in **Broc (718m)** and follow a regular (red/white) hiking path towards Col de Combes.
At around 1740m a blue/white alpine trail (T4) continues to **Dent de Broc (1828m)**. This
short part is exposed and leads us via a ridge to the summit. We take the same way back to the bifurcation
and then descend again on an easy trail. After a final short ascent to **Château de Gruyères** we
can enjoy our well deserved fondue!

The short T4 section is optional. Those who do not want to go do the summit can simply wait and
start having their lunch until the rest of the group returns. But either way, you need good physical
fitness for this hike.
