There are many ways to hike the super popular Rocher de Naye but this one is the
most rewarding one, has the best views and avoids all the usual crowds entirely.

We start the hike in **Roche (380m)** and take a steep hiking path through the forest to
**Malatraix (1767m)** from where the trail follows the ridge of the mountain to **Pointe à
l’Aiguille (1932m)** with one of the best views over Lake Geneva. Now we have to descend (those
2200m have to come from somewhere!) to **Col de Chaude** and ascend the last 400m to the summit of
**Rocher de Naye**. As we have exercised enough, we will take the train down to Montreux and back to
Geneva.

⚠️ **This is a very long hike with 2200m of vertical elevation gain. We will go at a steady (but
not running) pace. We will have short breaks but not a traditional long lunch break. You have to be
in very good physical fitness and be able to walk for 7-8 hours.**
