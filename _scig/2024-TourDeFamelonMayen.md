A challenging hike to the top of one of the two iconic twin peaks seen from afar with spectacular
views over lake Geneva, the Dent due Midi and the Mont Blanc massif.

We start the hike in **Leysin (1260m)** and hike up to the
**Tour de Famelon (2143m)**. We then descend the western side and cross a large field of Lapiaz to reach the base
of our next summit. We climb up a small chimney (with the use of cables) and reach the summit of the
**Tour de Mayen (2327m)** with its fantastic views. We then hike back down to Leysin.

This is a difficult hike with some exposed parts. A sure foot and good physical fitness is needed.
This hike will only be done in dry conditions (an alternative will be proposed otherwise).
