Usually Le Môle (1863m) would be considered an easy hike, but we are starting from the valley floor
using the Léman Express as our transport. There are no major difficulties on this hike, but
the altitude gain is significant and the first 900m in the forest are rather steep.
You need to be in good physical shape.

From the summit we will have unobstructed views over the Mont Blanc massif.
